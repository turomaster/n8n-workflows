# Save Workflow To GitHub

## Description
This workflow automates the process of saving an n8n workflow to a GitHub repository. It retrieves the workflow data, generates a README file using an AI agent, and then either creates or updates the workflow's JSON file and corresponding README in the repository.

 ðŸš€ This allows for easy version control and sharing of n8n workflows.

    - Execute Workflow Trigger
    - Code

## Setup Instructions

To use this workflow, you'll need to configure a few things:

1.  **n8n API Credentials:** âœ… Configure the n8n API credential to allow access to the workflow you want to save from the list.  You will also need to select the correct workflow from **Get Workflow From List**

2.  **GitHub OAuth2 Credentials:** âœ… Configure the GitHub OAuth2 API credential to enable interaction with your GitHub repository.

3.  **GitHub Repository:**  Make sure you set your desired user and repository to where the workflows will be saved.
